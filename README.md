"The developers for this hack are stupid, don't trust them. They even violate the data protection act but I guess nobody cares (https://www.gov.uk/data-protection). Your passwords are transmitted in (what is practically plaintext, XOR obfuscation does nothing for you especially when you have a number of 0'd bytes at the end of your packet that make it really easy to extract)" -Bartholomew
